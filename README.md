## 🚀 About Me 

Originally from a small town called Ahtaung(အထောင်) in Myanmar (Burma). Having graduated from med school in 2012, I practiced medicine for five years before moving to the UK to join my wife who works as a medical doctor for the NHS.

I've always been passionate about problem-solving and creation, sparked by my uncle, an architect engineer. It's this passion that led me to the world of programming. After hitting several roadblocks in the initial phase of my self-learning journey, I discovered Founders and Coders (FAC), a UK government-funded bootcamp.

By actively participating in FAC meetups from May 2023, I have embraced the thrill of building real projects and found my tribe in the coding community. My recent achievement is making it to the FAC29 cohort, selected as one of the 12 individuals for a 12-week training starting September 2023. By December, I'll have the opportunity to step into the world as a full-time developer!
