## 👨🏻‍💻 About Me:

- 🌱 I’m currently trained as a Software Developer at [Founders and Coders (FAC)](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/), a UK government-funded bootcamp who provide tuition-free, peer-led coding bootcamps to help people from all backgrounds get into tech and make a social impact.
  
- 🏡 Originally from a small town called Ahtaung(အထောင်) in Myanmar (Burma).

- 🎓 Having graduated from med school in 2012, I practiced medicine for five years before moving to the UK to join my wife who works as a medical doctor for the NHS.

- I've always been passionate about problem-solving and creation, sparked by my uncle, an architect engineer. It's this passion that led me to the world of programming.  I started to code out of curiosity during pandemic.
After hitting several roadblocks in the initial phase of my self-learning journey, I discovered FAC in 2023.

### 🐳 Why career change?
