# Hi there 👋, I'm Paing(π)

## 🚀 About Me 

I'm a Myanmar (Burma) native, hailing from a small town called Ahtaung(အထောင်). Having graduated from med school in 2012, I practiced medicine for five years before moving to the UK to join my wife who works as a Specialist Registrar for the NHS.

I've always been passionate about problem-solving and creation, sparked by my uncle, an architect engineer. It's this passion that led me to the world of programming. After hitting several roadblocks in the initial phase of my self-learning journey, I discovered Founders and Coders (FAC), a UK government-funded bootcamp.

Starting from May 2023, I've actively participated in FAC meetups, pushing my boundaries and experiencing the joy of building real projects. I've found my sense of belonging in the coding community, something I couldn't find in medicine.
